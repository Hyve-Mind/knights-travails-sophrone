The Odin project Knights Travails Project


Your task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.


1. Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
2. Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Don’t allow any moves to go off the board.
3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square.
